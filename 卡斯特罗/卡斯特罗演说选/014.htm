<p align="center"><font face="黑体">卡斯特罗谈苏联解体</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">"把一切问题都归绺于斯大林是对历史的简单化"――卡斯特罗</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">(Tomas Borge1992年7月3日对菲德尔卡斯特罗的采访)</font></p> 
<p><font face="黑体">问：孟德斯鸠说历史是包围某个事件的噪音，但有些事件，不仅仅是简单的噪音,象社会主义国家的崩溃和古巴革命的幸存一样。这是否意味着你们的历史正在走下坡路？</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">答：我想说：当社会主义阵营崩溃时，我们却决定不停地前进，而现在我们已成为罪恶的帝国主义者唯一攻击的牺牲品，这一简单的事实是历史上一个具有重要意义的事情。古巴决定不停地前进并面对随社会主义阵营的崩溃和苏联解体而来的危险和挑战这一简单事实是历史上的一个具有重要意义的事件。然而,Tomas,它不是一件我们也许现在可以结束或者我们从此以后也许就能够承受的事情。我相信这完全取决于将来会发生些什么，因为那才决定着我们今天正在做着的事业的真正意义。</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">问：无疑你对此很有信心，我对此也有信心。那是否意味着古巴革命是世界范围内社会主义方向道路复苏的开始吗？答：我相信我们在这一世界动荡时期正在捍卫的是尤其无比珍贵的一些原则。这也是机会主义者猖獗的一个时期，政客们正在试图使自己与这一时代相调和，我们可以说这一时期是帝国主义武力和政权被神化的时期。</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">人类以前从未经历过如此反动的扩张和帝国的建立。但这并不意味着它会永远继续下去。帝国正被各种矛盾所侵蚀。我们目前还在生存并坚持着我们的价值观，这对所有希望人类变得美好的人们来说是非常重要的。我相信而且从来都认为信念是很重要的,旗帜具有重要意义。我相信就算我们成了一个孤岛，它也具有很伟大的意义。如果我们受到侵略并能抵抗到底，那将有很伟大的意义。如果我们能够取胜,毫无疑问我们必将优势,因为要消灭千百万决心战斗到底的人民是不可能的，那将有很伟大的意义。问：你最近说,不是泛泛而谈而特别提到了社会主义苏联,说社会主义被暗杀了,后背上挨了一刀。你是否是说在除掉社会主义的恶毒阴谋中戈尔巴乔夫是凶手之一？</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">答：不,我不能说那些与戈尔巴乔夫有关，因为我对戈尔巴乔夫有另外的看法，他不是阴谋毁灭苏联的凶手之一。苏联以不可思议的方式自取灭亡。自我毁灭的责任无疑要由领导那个政权的国家领导人来承担。现在,他们有的人知道他们正在毁灭它，而其它人则不知道。这就是我过去，--或多或少--想努力说明的,我们都从一开始就看到了问题的全部。我不能说戈尔巴乔夫知道他在社会主义苏联毁灭中所起的作用，因为我确信戈尔巴乔夫正打算努力改进社会主义。我们赞同苏维埃在苏联为促进社会主义所付出的努力。但我们不能赞同，并且将来也永不同意：不仅社会主义在苏联遭到毁灭,而且苏联本身也遭到了毁灭。这给全世界人民带来了可怕的损失特别是给第三世界造成了更为恶劣的条件。如果苏维埃没有自我毁灭,如果那些对国家战略战术和国家政治、政府政策负责的人们没有毁灭苏联的话，帝国主义将也能瓦解这个国家。换句话说,社会主义不是自然灭亡的：它是自杀,社会主义是被密谋扼杀的。这就是我的意思。</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">问：菲德尔，对大多数拉丁美洲国家的革命领导人来说,当前社会主义的危机的出现有一个策划者：他就是约瑟夫・斯大林。</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">答：我相信斯大林犯了很大错误但同时也显示出了伟大的智慧。照我看来,把在苏联发生的任何事情都归绺于斯大林是对历史的简单化,因为没有一个人自已就能创造出一定的条件。它就正象苏联曾经把所有的功劳都赋予斯大林一样。那是不可能的！我相信千百万英雄人民的努力为苏联的发展和它符合千百万人利益的世界地位做出了贡献。我为很多事情批评了斯大林。首先,我批评了他对法律体制的违背。我相信斯大林犯了滥用权力的错误。这是我一直坚持的另一个的坚信不移的观点。</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">我感到斯大林的农业政策没有发展到使土地社会化的进步程度。照我看来,土地社会化的过程应该更早地开始并逐渐地推行。由于它的猛烈推行，一个很短的历史时期内在经济和社会方面都负出了很高的代价。我还感到斯大林在战争以前的政策是完全错误的。没人否认西方国家的绥靖政策促使希特勒成为一个猛兽,一个真正的威胁。不能否认西方国家在希特勒面前显示出了极端的软弱无能。这刺激了希特勒的扩张政策和斯大林的恐惧,恐惧导致斯大林做了我会终生批判的一些事情,因为我认为这是对原则的公然违背：为了拖延时间，不惜任何代价与希特勒缔结和平条约。在我们的革命生涯中,在相对慢长的古巴革命历史期间,我们从来没有为赢得时间或为获得任何实际的优势在一个原则问题和敌人谈判。当德国人已经要求移交但泽走廊时，斯大林还倾心于有名的Molotov-Ribbentrop条约。我感到,互不侵犯条约远非赢得了时间,而是缩短了时间,因为不管怎样战争总要爆发。依我之见,他犯了另一个大错误,因为当波兰正在遭到攻击时,他应该派遣部队占领那片领土,这里有乌克兰人或俄罗斯居民--我不敢肯定--是一个有争议的地区。我还相信从原则的立场和国际法的立场来说，对芬兰的那场规模不大的战争是另一个可怕的错误。斯大林犯了被世界上大部分地区批评的一系列错误,这些错误使共产主义者（他们是苏联的伟大朋友）由于必须支持那些事件中的每一个而处于十分困难的位置。既然我们正在讨论这个话题,我得必须告诉你我从来没与任何记者讨论过这个(或在其它任何场合，他补充说)。</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">我所提及的事情违背了原则和学说;他们甚至违背了政治谋略的智慧。尽管从1939年9月到1941年6月这一年零九个月的时间苏联确实能够重新武装了自己，但希特勒也变得更强大了。如果希特勒在1939年对苏联宣战，破坏将小于1941年造成的，他也许将遭受和拿破仑波拿巴一样的命运。在人民参予这场不规则战争的情况下，苏联将击败希特勒。最后说说斯大林的性格,他对任何事情都极端地不信任,这使他犯了另外的错误：其中之一是落在德国人阴谋的陷井里，并且进行了一场对武装力量可怕的,血醒的清洗，实际上在大战的前夜重创了苏维埃军队。</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">问：你认为斯大林的优点是什么？</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">答：他确立了苏联的统一。他巩固了列宁开始的事业：维护党的统一。他再次推动了国际革命运动。苏联的工业化是斯大林最明智的行动之一，我相信它是一个决定苏联抵抗外敌入侵能力的决定性因素。斯大林及其支持者的最伟大的功绩之一是把军事工业和主要战略工业迁移到西伯利亚地区并深入苏维埃领土的计划。我相信斯大林在卫国战争期间对苏联领导得很好。根据许多将军，如朱可夫和最出众的苏维埃将军们回忆，斯大林在保卫苏联反击纳粹主义的战争中起了重要的作用。他们都承认这一点。我认为应该对斯大林有公正的分析。把任何事情都归绺于他是对历史的过分简单化。</font></p>

<p><font face="黑体">El Nuevo Diario Interview with Fidel Castro:</font></p> 
<p><font face="黑体">Blaming Stalin for everything would be historical simplism</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">By Tomas Borge</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">First Published: El Nuevo Diario, Managua, 3 June 1992</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">Q: Montesquieu said history is the noise surrounding certain events, but there are events that are simply not noise, like the collapse of the socialist countries and the survival of the Cuban revolution. Does this at mean you are going down in history?</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">A: I would say the simple fact that we decided to keep going forward when the socialist bloc collapsed, and now that we have become the only victim of a vicious imperialist attack, is a significant event in history. The mere fact that Cuba has decided to keep going forward and face the dangers and the challenges following the collapse of the socialist bloc and the disappearance of the USSR is a significant event in history.</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">Tomas, it is not a matter, however, of what we may have done up until now or of what we may be capable of withstanding from here on. I believe it all depends on what lies ahead because that will determine the real significance of what we are doing today. 
</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">Q: Undoubtedly you have much confidence in that, and I share it. Does that mean the Cuban revolution is the beginning of a resurrection of a socialist option at the world level?</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">A: I believe we are defending certain principles that are immensely, extraordinarily valuable at a moment of confusion in the world. It is a time for opportunists, a time in which politicians are trying to accommodate themselves, and we may say it is a time of apotheosis for imperialist military and political power.</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">Mankind has never before experienced such a reactionary expansion and empire building. That does not mean it will go on forever. That empire is corroded by all types of contradictions. We are living in the present and I believe that preserving our values is of great importance for all men who want the best for humanity. I believe and I have always believed that symbols are of great importance, flags are of great value. I believe that even if we became a lonely island, that would be of great value. If we were invaded and were capable of resisting until the end, that would have great value. If we were capable of prevailing, as we will undoubtedly prevail, because it would be impossible to exterminate millions of men determined to fight, that would have great value.</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">Q: You recently said, not referring to socialism in general but to the USSR in particular, that socialism had been assassinated, stabbed in the back. In this conspiracy of daggers that killed socialism, would you say Gorbachev was one of the assassins?</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">A: No, I could not say that about Gorbachev because I have another view of Gorbachev and it is not one of an assassin who plotted the USSR's destruction.</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">The USSR self-destructed in an incredible way. The responsibility for that self-destruction undoubtedly lies in the hands of the country's leaders, those who led that nation. Now, some of them were aware they were destroying it and others were not. That is what I was trying to say, more or less, and we saw it all from the beginning.</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">I cannot say Gorbachev played a role in which he was aware of the destruction of the USSR because I have no doubt that Gorbachev intended to fight to improve socialism.</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">We approved of Soviet efforts to improve socialism in the USSR. But we could not approve of, and never would have agreed to, not only the destruction of socialism in the USSR, but also the destruction of the USSR itself. That inflicted terrible damage on all peoples of the world and created a bad situation for the Third World in particular.</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">Imperialism would have been able to disintegrate the Soviet Union, had the Soviets not destroyed themselves, had those responsible for the strategies and tactics and for the country's political and government policies not destroyed the country. In other words, socialism did not die from natural causes: it was a suicide, socialism was murdered. That is what I meant.</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">Q: Fidel, for most Latin American revolutionary leaders, the current crisis of socialism has a mastermind: Josef Stalin.</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">A: I believe Stalin made big mistakes but also showed great wisdom.</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">In my opinion, blaming Stalin for everything that occurred in the Soviet Union would be historical simplism, because no man by himself could have created certain conditions. It would be the same as giving Stalin all the credit for what the USSR once was. That is impossible! I believe that the efforts of millions and millions of heroic people contributed to the USSR's development and to its relevant role in the world in favor of hundreds of millions of people.</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">I have criticized Stalin for a lot of things. First of all, I criticized his violation of the legal framework.</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">I believe Stalin committed an enormous abuse of power. That is another conviction I have always had.</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">I feel that Stalin's agricultural policy did not develop a progressive process to socialize land. In my opinion, the land socialization process should have begun earlier and should have been gradually implemented. Because of its violent implementation, it had a very high economic and human cost in a very brief period of history.</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">I also feel that Stalin's policy prior to the war was totally erroneous. No one can deny that western powers promoted Hitler until he became a monster, a real threat. The terrible weakness shown by western powers before Hitler cannot be denied. This at encouraged Hitler's expansionism and Stalin's fear, which led Stalin to do something I will criticize all my life, because I believe that it was a flagrant violation of principles: seek peace with Hitler at any cost, stalling for time.</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">During our revolutionary life, during the relatively long history of the Cuban Revolution, we have never negotiated a single principle to gain time, or to obtain any practical advantage. Stalin fell for the famous Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact at a time when Germans were already demanding the delivery of the Danzig Corridor.</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">I feel that, far from gaining time, the nonaggression pact reduced time, because the war broke out anyway. Then, in my opinion, he made another big mistake, because when Poland was being attacked, he sent troops to occupy that territory, which was disputed because it had a Ukrainian or Russian population, I am not sure.</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">I also believe that the little war against Finland was another terrible mistake, from the standpoint of principles and international law.</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">Stalin made a series of mistakes that were criticized by a large part of the world, and which placed Communists - who were great friends of the USSR - in a very difficult position by having to support each one of those episodes.</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">Since we are discussing this topic, I must tell you that I have never discussed it with any journalist (or on any other occasion, he added).</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">The things I mentioned are against principles and doctrine; they are even contrary to political wisdom. Although it is true that there was a period of one year and nine months from September 1939 to June 1941 during which the USSR could have rearmed itself, Hitler was the one who got stronger.</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">If Hitler had declared war on the USSR in 1939, the destruction would have been less than the destruction caused in 1941, and he would have suffered the same fate as Napoleon Bonaparte. With the people's participation in an irregular war, the USSR would have defeated Hitler.</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">Finally, Stalin's character, his terrible distrust of everything, made him commit several other mistakes: one of them was falling in the trap of German intrigue and conducting a terrible, bloody purge of the armed forces and practically beheading the Soviet Army on the eve of war.</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">Q: What do you believe were Stalin's merits?</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">A: He established unity in the Soviet Union. He consolidated what Lenin had begun: party unity. He gave the international revolutionary movement a new impetus. The USSR's industrialization was one of Stalin's wisest actions, and I believe it was a determining factor in the USSR's capacity to resist.</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">One of Stalin's - and the team that supported him - greatest merits was the plan to transfer the war industry and main strategic industries to Siberia and deep into Soviet territory.</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">I believe Stalin led the USSR well during the war. According to many generals, Zhukov and the most brilliant Soviet generals, Stalin played an important role in defending the USSR and in the war against Nazism. They all recognized it.</font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">I think there should be an impartial analysis of Stalin. Blaming him for everything that happened would be historical simplism.</font></p>
