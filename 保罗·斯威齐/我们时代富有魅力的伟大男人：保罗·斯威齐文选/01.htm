<p><font face="黑体"><center>保罗・斯威齐生平简介</center></font></p>
<p><font face="黑体">保罗・斯威齐（Paul M. Sweezy），1910年生于纽约，父亲为华尔街银行家。1937年获得哈佛大学经济学博士学位。提出了著名的需求曲线，成为现代西方经济学理论的一个重要内容，本人也成为西方经济学界的青年才俊。30年代经济大萧条后迅速转向马克思主义政治经济学，从此遭到西方主流经济学界的排斥。1942年出版成名作《资本主义发展论》，同时也因此而遭到西方资产阶级经济学家的围剿，并丢掉了在哈佛大学的教职。此后，他曾先后担任康奈尔、耶鲁、斯坦福、曼彻斯特等大学的客座教授。1949年创办左翼杂志《每月评论》。陆续发表了大量揭露和批判现代资本主义的文章和专著，其中最著名的有《作为历史的现在》(1953年)、《垄断资本》(与保罗・巴兰合著，1966年)、《繁荣的终结》(与哈里・麦格道夫合著，1981年)、《革命后社会》(1982年)、《马克思主义四讲》》(1982年)。这些论著有非常广泛的影响。日本现代经济研究会曾把斯威齐列为自魁奈以来30位大经济学家之一。</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Paul Sweezy is best known in economics for two not-so-distinct concerns which have dominated his economics: analyzing monopolistic competition and updating Marxian thought into &quot;Neo-Marxian&quot; economics. His work on the former is best exemplified by his discovery of the &quot;kinked&quot; demand curve for oligopoly (1939) and his prize-winning study on the English coal industry (1938).</font></p> 
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Sweezy encountered Marxian theory soon enough and in his majestic 1942 book, Theory of Capitalist Development, helped reintroduce Marxian thought to economics - in particular drawing attention to Marx's &quot;Transformation Problem&quot; and the theory of crisis. Sweezy subsequently translated Bawerk's classic 1896 critique of Marx as well as Hilferding's response. He also became involved in an infamous debate with Dobb on the issue of the transition from feudalism to capitalism (e.g. 1976).</font></p> 
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">It was hardly surprising, then, that this young Harvard economist was to became a favorite of Schumpeter's and an anathema to the American government (Sweezy was summoned and jailed for &quot;contempt&quot; by the McCarthyite New Hampshire legal establishment in 1953 - a conviction only overturned in 1957 by the US Supreme Court (see statement by 
Sweezy)).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Sweezy was also a proponent of an &quot;underconsumption&quot; interpretation of Marx, a new theory of imperialism rooted in &quot;dependency&quot; and the examination of Keynesian demand management as a life-valve for capitalism - ideas commonly associated with the Monthly Review, which Sweezy helped found in 1949 and which he edited for the rest of his career which was to be highly influential on the emerging &quot;New Left&quot;. Sweezy saw these ideas as a way of modernising the Marxian theory of crisis and he set them forth both in his numerous writings in the Monthly Review and, perhaps most famously, in his highly influential Monopoly Capital (1966) written with Paul 
Baran.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Mr. Sweezy cofounded the Marxist journal The Monthly Review in 1949. He edited and wrote about 100 articles for the journal, which currently has a monthly circulation of about 7,000. Other contributors included Albert Einstein, W.E.B. Du Bois, Jean-Paul Sartre, Che Guevara, and Joan Robinson.</font></p> 
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Mr. Sweezy wrote more than 20 books, including a well-known collaboration with Paul Baran, &quot;Monopoly Capital: An Essay on the American Economic and Social Order&quot; (1966). Throughout his career, he argued that government and working people had to cooperate to overcome what he saw as capitalism's limitations.</font></p> 
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Born in New York City, the son of a J.P. Morgan banker, Mr. Sweezy attended Philips Exeter Academy and Harvard University, where he was president of the Harvard Crimson.</font></p> 
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">While working on his doctorate at Harvard, Mr. Sweezy had as a mentor famed economist Joseph Schumpeter, the preeminent defender of free enterprise who lauded the &quot;creative destruction&quot; of vibrant capitalism. Their friendship deepened even as their economic viewpoints diverged.</font></p> 
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">As the Great Depression lingered, Mr. Sweezy became an advocate of greater government control of the economy. &quot;I became convinced that mainstream economics of the kind I had been taught at Harvard had little to contribute toward understanding the major events and trends of the 20th century,&quot; he later wrote.</font></p> 
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Schumpeter and Mr. Sweezy's debates became legendary in some circles at Harvard. One, titled &quot;The Future of Capitalism&quot; and held at a packed hall at the Littauer Center, was retold decades later in Newsweek by Nobel laureate and MIT professor Paul Samuelson, setting the scene as one &quot;back in the days when giants walked the earth and Harvard Yard.&quot;</font></p> 
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&quot;Unfairly, the gods had given Paul Sweezy, along with a brilliant mind, a beautiful face and wit. With what William Buckley would desperately wish to see in the mirror, Sweezy laced the world,&quot; Samuelson wrote.Samuelson called them &quot;foxy Merlin&quot; (Schumpeter) against Mr. Sweezy's &quot;young Sir Galahad.&quot;&quot;The neat parrying and thrust . . . all made more pleasurable by the obvious affection that the two men had for each other despite the polar opposition of their views.&quot;</font></p> 
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">During World War II, Mr. Sweezy worked in the research department of the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency.He later returned to Harvard as an instructor, but failed to secure a tenured position and left the university in 1946.</font></p> 
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In the 1950s, during the height of McCarthyism, the New Hampshire attorney general accused Mr. Sweezy of subversive activities after he refused to turn over some lecture notes. The case ended up in the Supreme Court, which ruled in Mr. Sweezy's favor.</font></p>
